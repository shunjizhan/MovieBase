IMPORTANT
This is EXAMPLE code.
There are a few things missing:
1) You may need to play with the colors in the US map.
2) This code assumes you are running in Jupyter Notebook or on your own system.
   If you are using the VM, you will instead need to play with writing the images
   to PNG files with decent margins and sizes.
3) The US map only has code for the Positive case. I leave the negative case to you.
4) Alaska and Hawaii got dropped off the map, but it's late, and I want you to have this
   code. So, if you can fix Hawaii and Alask, ExTrA CrEdIt. The source contains info
   about adding them back.
